# Crypto Math Hunt 2023

## Objective
The Crypto Math Hunt is an interactive and challenging event designed to engage participants in solving mathematical and cryptographic puzzles. The primary goal is to test participants' problem-solving skills, teamwork, and cryptographic knowledge within a time-constrained, competitive environment.

## Team Structure:
Teams, ideally consisting of 4 to 6 members, are encouraged to register for the event through a provided Google Form link. Participants must bring laptops for effective engagement, and in the absence of laptops, teams may be split accordingly. The event is orchestrated by a Game Master and a Hunt Coordinator for each room.
